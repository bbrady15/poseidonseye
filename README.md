# Poseidon's Eye
Ship Detection and Recognition Utilizing Web Camera Streams 

# Objectives
The objective of this project where to:
* Source images that can be used to create a data set
* Annotate sourced images to create a computer vision data set
* Train a model utilizing YOLOv5 in order to create weights to use for image recognition
* Feed videos into Computer Vision Program (CVP) to test the weights created 
* Refine weights and CVP
* Feed CVP live streams to detect ships 

# Approach
**Step 1**
* Utilizing Roboflow, a dataset was created
